iOS version has been removed from App store because of the expiration of the Apple developer membership I used.

这是一个跨平台的24点求解程序，可以在 iOS Android Windows 和 macOS上运行。最初只是因为高中有段时间大家都在玩24点，但是装在我的touch上的求解器经常给出错误的解，同时又想试试iOS开发，于是就做了这个。上传到App store的第一个版本实际上一共只花了我一个双休日，还包含研究设置Mac虚拟机的时间。之后源码丢过一次，好在我朋友有一份，于是就干脆丢到Github上了。

This is a cross-platform app used to solve the game '24 game'. It supports iOS Android Windows & macOS. The reason for building this is there was a time in high school a lot of people were playing the '24 game' and the solver I found always gave me a wrong answer(Also iOS developing was a hot topic at that time).  
 Actually the first version I submitted to App store only took me a weekend to built (including the time of setting up a mac virtual machine). I lost the code once and found a copy from my friend. After that, I decided to open the source code.
